# Hospital-Database

To implement my database, I used the MySQL database for python. The python program is menu driven. The SQL statements are written in the python program and access the online database via the cursor. My program initially asks the user what operation he/she would like to perform on the database. Depending on what the user selects, the program will ask for the necessary inputs and then incorporate these inputs into the SQL statements.
